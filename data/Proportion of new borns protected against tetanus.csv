The model aims to improve the accuracy of this indicator by capturing or including other potential scenarios where women might be protected (e.g., women who receive doses of TT in supplemental immunization activities).

Due to the cession in July 2011 of the Republic of South Sudan by the Republic of the Sudan, and its subsequent admission to the UN on 14 July 2011, disaggregated data for Sudan and South Sudan as separate States are not yet available for all indicators. In these cases, aggregated data are presented for Sudan pre-cession (see Memorandum item)."
