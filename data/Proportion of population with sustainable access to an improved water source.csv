In these cases, aggregated data are presented for Sudan pre-cession (see Memorandum item). The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme For Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) closed its databases for these estimates before the cession  of the Republic of South Sudan by the Republic of the Sudan. Aggregated data presented are for the Sudan pre-cession. Disaggregated data for the Sudan and South Sudan as separate States will be published by the JMP in 2013. "
