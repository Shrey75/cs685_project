"1","Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified in the column heading. The maternal mortality data in the column headed 'reported' refer to data reported by national authorities. The data in the column headed 'adjusted' refer to the 2010 United Nations inter-agency maternal mortality estimates that were released in late 2012.

Please note that these values are not comparable with previously reported maternal mortality ratio 'adjusted' values, mainly due to an increase in the number of data sources and countries included in the latest round of estimation.

"3","Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified in the column heading. Data refer to years or periods other than those specified in the column heading. Such data are not included in the calculation of regional and global averages, with the exception of 2005-2006 data from India. Estimates from data years prior to 2000 are not displayed. Due to the cession in July 2011 of the Republic of South Sudan by the Republic of the Sudan, and its subsequent admission to the UN on 14 July 2011, disaggregated data for Sudan and South Sudan as separate States are not yet available for all indicators. In these cases, aggregated data are presented for Sudan pre-cession (see Memorandum item). The maternal mortality data in the column headed 'reported' refer to data reported by national authorities. The data in the column headed 'adjusted' refer to the 2010 United Nations inter-agency maternal mortality estimates that were released in late 2012. Periodically, the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank) produces internationally comparable sets of maternal mortality data that account for the well-documented problems of under-reporting and misclassification of maternal deaths, including also estimates for countries with no data. Please note that these values are not comparable with previously reported maternal mortality ratio 'adjusted' values, mainly due to an increase in the number of data sources and countries included in the latest round of estimation. Comparable time series on maternal mortality ratios for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are available at <www.childinfo.org>."
